# Simple Clock

A page displaying a clock, written in **CSS** and **JavaScript**.  
  
You can see a [**live DEMO here**](https://mkspcd.github.io/SimpleClock/).  
  
The hours and minutes are displayed in the center, the circular progress bar fills itself as the seconds pass.

**JavaScript** is used to modify some elements' classes and style, based on the number of second of the current time. 

**CSS** is used for its *clipping property*, and its *rotation transformation* property (amongst other things) to display the rounded clock correctly.
